# About me 🐼

- 🔭 Currently working as a full stack web developer in a tutorships program implemented both in Santiago (capital) and the south region of Chile by Focus Consultancy Agency for MINEDUC (Ministerio de Educación de Chile). Parallally working in a couple of minor projects also as full stack (GOZ Chile, ECOMEK and WDigital).
- 🌱 I'm learning programming languages (mainly Typescript, Python and SQL) to be able to achieve more complex actions with data and be more efficient in data handling and front-end engineering.
- 🫂 I’m looking to collaborate on Web3 projects, aiming to decentralize the internet while protecting users data and privacy.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with being able to program my Airtable bases from outside of Airtable -> Basically I would like to control my Airtable data from outside (VSCode), so I need to learn SQL and how to save, update, and connect to my Low Code front-end (maybe even migrate from it), among others... BTW I recently discovered the Bluedot Impact Airtable Standards which I have applied to my bases since then, now not only they look beautiful, but I can proudly say I'm able to move and program much quicker and with less errors than ever.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I got into this world "by chance", actually I was pursuing a much different path. Last year I applied to a psychology bachelor degree at  university, I didn't made it so I ended up working as a waiter in a restorant, one day I received a call which was basically a cry for help to build an Airtable ecosystem that could handle a huge project in record time, I had little to none experience in Airtable but I had it listed in my LinkedIn profile (lol) and I matched a couple of other requirements from the client, I really wanted to get off the job I was on, so I thankfully took it, and here I am.
