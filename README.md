# About me 🐼

- 🔭 I'm a full stack web developer especialized in workflows efficiency. Born in Santiago, Chile and currently based in Porto, Portugal.
- 🌱 I self taught me the basics of web developing, from no-code tools, to low-code and currently in transition to full-code with SQL, Javascript, Python, HTML and CSS.
- 🫂 I’m looking to collaborate on Web3 projects, aiming to decentralize the internet while protecting users data and privacy.
- 💬 ~Ask me about~ Let's exchange music and films.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I got into this world "by chance", actually I was pursuing a much different path. I got out of Chile to apply to a psychology bachelor degree at university, but I didn't got in, so I ended up working as a waiter in a restorant, one day I received a call which was basically a cry for help to build a low-code full stack ecosystem that could handle a national-wide project in record time, I had little to none experience in Airtable (but I had it listed in my LinkedIn profile as Airtable Expert (lol)) and I matched a couple of other requirements for the client, I really wanted to get off the job I was on so I thankfully took it. 2 years later, I'm a freelance developer, I have valuable skills, I manage my own time and have control over the projects I work with, so I couldn't be happier :)
